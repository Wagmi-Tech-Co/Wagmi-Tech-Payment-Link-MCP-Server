## Architecture

This server follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **`core/`** - Core business logic and interfaces
- **`providers/`** - Payment provider implementations (Moka United, extensible for others)
- **`utils/`** - Utility functions (logging, authentication, validation)
- **`errors/`** - Custom error handling classes
- **`config/`** - Configuration management

## Transport Mode

This server uses **stdio transport** for direct MCP client connections via stdin/stdout communication.

## Docker Usage

### Building the Image
```bash
docker build -t payment-mcp-server .
```

### Running the Server
```bash
# Run with environment variables
docker run -it \
  -e PROVIDER="moka" \
  -e DEALER_CODE="your_dealer_code" \
  -e USERNAME="your_username" \
  -e PASSWORD="your_password" \
  -e CUSTOMER_TYPE_ID="your_customer_id" \
  payment-mcp-server

# Or with .env file
docker run -it --env-file .env payment-mcp-server

# Run with different provider (currently only moka is supported)
docker run -it \
  -e PROVIDER="moka" \
  -e DEALER_CODE="your_dealer_code" \
  -e USERNAME="your_username" \
  -e PASSWORD="your_password" \
  payment-mcp-server

# The server communicates via stdin/stdout for direct MCP client connection
```

## Docker Compose Usage

```bash
# Create .env file with your credentials first
echo "PROVIDER=moka" > .env

echo "USERNAME=your_username" >> .env  
echo "PASSWORD=your_password" >> .env
