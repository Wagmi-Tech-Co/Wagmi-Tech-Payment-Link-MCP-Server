## Usage with MCP Client (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor)

### 1. Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t payment-mcp-server .
```

### 2. Configure MCP Client
Add the server configuration to your MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor):

**For stdio transport :**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "payment-mcp-server": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e", "PROVIDER",
        "-e", "DEALER_CODE",
        "-e", "USERNAME",
        "-e", "PASSWORD",
        "-e", "CUSTOMER_TYPE_ID",
        "-e", "TRANSPORT",
        "payment-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PROVIDER": "moka",
        "DEALER_CODE": "your_dealer_code",
        "USERNAME": "your_username",
        "PASSWORD": "your_password",
        "CUSTOMER_TYPE_ID": "your_customer_type_id",
        "TRANSPORT": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For SSE transport (default):**

First, run the server:
```bash
docker run -p 8050:8050 payment-mcp-server
```

Then configure your MCP client to connect via HTTP:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "payment-mcp-server": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8050/sse",
      "headers": {
        "X-Dealer-Code": "your_dealer_code",
        "X-Username": "your_username",
        "X-Password": "your_password",
        "X-Customer-Type-ID": "your_customer_type_id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Test the Server (Optional)
```bash
# Test with SSE transport (default)
docker run -p 8050:8050 payment-mcp-server
# Then access via http://localhost:8050/health

# Test with stdio transport 
docker run -it \
  -e PROVIDER="moka" \
  -e DEALER_CODE="your_dealer_code" \
  -e USERNAME="your_username" \
  -e PASSWORD="your_password" \
  -e CUSTOMER_TYPE_ID="your_type_id" \
  -e TRANSPORT="stdio" \
  payment-mcp-server

```

### 4. Ready to Use in MCP Client
Once configured, you can use the `create_payment_link` tool in your MCP client to create  payment requests.

## Architecture

This server follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **`core/`** - Core business logic and interfaces
- **`providers/`** - Payment provider implementations (Moka United, extensible for others)
- **`utils/`** - Utility functions (logging, authentication, validation)
- **`errors/`** - Custom error handling classes
- **`config/`** - Configuration management

## Transport Modes

This server supports two transport modes:

### 1. **stdio transport** 
For direct MCP client connections via stdin/stdout communication.

### 2. **SSE transport** (Server-Sent Events) - Default
For multi-tenant support with per-connection authentication. This allows:
- **Multiple concurrent connections** with different credentials
- **Per-connection authentication** via headers
- **Real-time payment link creation** across multiple sessions
- **Multi-tenant architecture** for businesses with multiple accounts
- **Scalable architecture** for businesses with multiple touchpoints

**Connection method**: Set `TRANSPORT=sse` and connect via HTTP (e.g., `http://localhost:8050/sse`)

Perfect for:

- **Multi-tenant applications** where each user has different credentials
- **Call centers** with multiple agents using different merchant accounts
- **SaaS platforms** serving multiple customers
- **Team environments** with different payment provider accounts

#### SSE Transport Features

**Authentication**: Per-connection via headers
- `X-Dealer-Code`: Your dealer code
- `X-Username`: Your username
- `X-Password`: Your password
- `X-Customer-Type-ID`: Customer type ID (required)

**Supported Header Formats** (case-insensitive):
- `X-Dealer-Code`, `Dealer-Code`, `dealercode`
- `X-Username`, `Username`, `username`
- `X-Password`, `Password`, `password`
- `X-Customer-Type-ID`, `Customer-Type-ID`, `customertypeid`

**Health Check**: `GET /health` endpoint for monitoring


## Docker Usage

### Building the Image
```bash
docker build -t payment-mcp-server .
```

### Running the Server

**SSE Transport (Default - Recommended)**
```bash
# Run SSE server (credentials via headers at connection time)
docker run -p 8050:8050 payment-mcp-server

# With specific transport and port
docker run -p 8050:8050 -e TRANSPORT="sse" payment-mcp-server

# SSE transport with LibreChat integration
# No environment variables needed - credentials via headers
docker run -p 8050:8050 -e TRANSPORT="sse" payment-mcp-server
```

**stdio Transport**
```bash
# Run with environment variables (required for stdio)
docker run -it \
  -e DEALER_CODE="your_dealer_code" \
  -e USERNAME="your_username" \
  -e PASSWORD="your_password" \
  -e CUSTOMER_TYPE_ID="your_customer_type_id" \
  -e TRANSPORT="stdio" \
  payment-mcp-server

# Or with .env file
docker run -it --env-file .env -e TRANSPORT="stdio" payment-mcp-server
```

**Health Check**
```bash
# Check if SSE server is running
curl http://localhost:8050/health
```

## Docker Compose Usage

**For SSE Transport (Default)**
```bash
# Run SSE server (no credentials needed in .env)
docker-compose --profile sse up

# Or simply (default profile)
docker-compose up

# Server runs at http://localhost:8050
# Health check at http://localhost:8050/health
```

**For stdio Transport**
```bash
# Create .env file with your credentials first (required for stdio)
echo "PROVIDER=moka" > .env
echo "DEALER_CODE=your_dealer_code" >> .env
echo "USERNAME=your_username" >> .env  
echo "PASSWORD=your_password" >> .env
echo "CUSTOMER_TYPE_ID=your_type_id" >> .env

# Run with stdio transport
docker-compose --profile stdio up
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required For |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `PROVIDER` | Payment provider to use | moka | Both |
| `DEALER_CODE` | Payment provider dealer code | - | stdio transport only |
| `USERNAME` | Payment provider username | - | stdio transport only |
| `PASSWORD` | Payment provider password | - | stdio transport only |
| `CUSTOMER_TYPE_ID` | Customer type ID | - | stdio transport only |
| `TRANSPORT` | Transport mode (stdio/sse) | sse | Both |

## CLI Options

| Option | Description | Default | Required For |
|--------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `--provider` | Payment provider to use (env: PROVIDER) | moka | Both |
| `--dealer-code` | Payment provider dealer code | - | stdio transport only |
| `--username` | Payment provider username | - | stdio transport only |
| `--password` | Payment provider password | - | stdio transport only |
| `--customer-type-id` | Customer type ID | - | stdio transport only |
| `--host` | Server host | 0.0.0.0 | sse transport only |
| `--port` | Server port | 8050 | sse transport only |
| `--transport` | Transport mode (stdio/sse) (env: TRANSPORT) | sse | Both |

**Note**: For SSE transport, credentials are provided via headers at connection time, not CLI options.

## Logs

Logs are saved to `/app/logs/` inside the container. To persist logs, mount a volume:

```bash
docker run -v ./logs:/app/logs payment-mcp-server
```

## Development


### Adding New Providers

1. Create a new provider directory under `providers/`
2. Implement the `PaymentProvider` interface
3. Add provider to the factory in `providers/factory.py`
4. Update documentation

### Security

- Credentials are never logged in production
- SSE transport allows per-connection authentication
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- HTTPS recommended for production deployments
